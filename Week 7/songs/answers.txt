If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

-- If we calculate all the basic parameters for this task, we will get high level of energy (0.65906), high level of danceability (0.71646) and moderate valence.
Seems like that combination give as Orange and Blue auras.





Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

-- I can calculate the average value of danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, valence, tempo and duration.
But of course, this method will not be very representative of the listener.
So generally we can add some additional variables such as the lisneter's mood, preferred bands, and etc. And use some algorithms or machine learning.
